              Below is a subset of the positive student testimonials and
              comments on my lecturing, course design, and mentorship that I’ve
              received since starting at UCSD. Most were gathered from
              end-of-quarter course evaluations, but some were collected through
              other means, such as emails from students. Com- ments are roughly
              organized into areas by their subject; although some could
              reasonably be placed in multiple categories, each comment appears
              only once. Where necessary, I’ve added some explanatory notes of
              my own; these look like:

              Justin provides a learning experience that is unmatched in data
              science. With his teaching style it is easy to get the key
              concepts down in order to apply them later on in homeworks. He
              provides a really strong sense of the applications of the concepts
              we're learning as well as a comforting sense of direction. Very
              professional, feels like he's concerned with our well-being and
              our academic success and you can tell he puts a lot of time and
              effort into his classes and material.

              Justin is amazing. I have had hime for 4 classes at my time at

              clear, and I walk away from every class feeling as if I could re
              explain the concepts I just learned. That's not something that
              really happens with every professor.

              really helps ensure that I do not get burned out from the lecture
              material. His teaching methods are excellent as he makes all of
              the concepts very digestible and in such a way that it makes
              perfect logical sense. I really cannot say more good things about
              Professor Eldridge. I highly recommend taking his courses.

              One of the best professors to have graced this university, he is a

              topics. No matter how difficult the topic may be at first, he will
              always spend enough time so that nearly all students can go
              through the same thought process. His lab and homework structures
              are also fun; they aren't incredibly difficult, but are somewhat
              easy with how much hand holding they do (which is understandable).

                <i>Note from Justin:</i>
                The student notes that the homeworks "hand hold", and I believe
                they are picking up on some of the intentional "scaffolding" I
                put in place when designing homeworks. I often start with a very
                challenging problem that requires the student to explore unseen
                concepts or tackle tough computations. I then break the problem
                into subproblems that outline the correct strategy. To get the
                overall correct anwer, however, the student not only needs to
                think about each subproblem individually, but how they fit
                together.

              In my humble opinion, Justin is one of the best data science
              faculty at HDSI (don't tell Marina I said that!). I went into this
              class fully expecting to scrape by with a C- but to my surprise I
              am acing it. And this is all thanks to Professor Eldridge's
              wonderful teaching. He is really wonderful at explaining every
              concept from the basic fundamentals to more complex data
              structures. I appreciated the way that each lecture was broken
              down into smaller sections. He was also great at answering
              questions asked on CampusWire or office hours. I would like for
              him to assign more homework. Also, this might be a strange
              request, but if he is comfortable with it, I would appreciate if
              he turned on his camera during office hours. I would have love to
              turn on my camera in order to talk face to face but since his was
              off I felt really awkward doing so. Anyways, Professor Eldridge
              was awesome, can't wait to have him again next quarter!

                The student rightfully comments that I didn't turn my camera on
                during Zoom office hours. I usually would have my camera on
                because I think it's important for creating a connection with
                students. However, in Winter 2021 I was recovering from a
                herniated disc which prevented me from sitting or standing for
                long periods. As such, all of my Zoom meetings were held with me
                laying on my back -- and with my camera off.

              class. Granted that not many professors are willing to do that
              anymore, I found this especially supportive of immunocompromised
              students such as myself. I think it is great that he worked to
              create an environment that is accessible to students, regardless
              of disability. Although I feel he should be doing this for every
              lecture, he should keep up the good work.

                <i>Note from Justin:</i>
                I should clarify that I didn't come to campus when I was sick!
                Rather, when I was sick and possibly contagious, I cancelled the
                in-person component of lecture and delivered the content
                remotely. However, when I returned to campus, I wore the mask
                for the next couple of lectures to prevent spreading germs in
                the unlikely case that I was still contagious, and to help
                students feel more comfortable. It should also be noted that
                masking was no longer required or recommended by the campus
                guidelines at this time.

              I really enjoyed having class with Justin for a few reasons.
              First, he tries very hard to make the course material engaging
              (through examples, pictures, etc) and to promote conversation
              amongst students in class through discussion questions. Second, he
              very clearly cares about students in the course. Several lectures
              ago a student in our class had what appeared to be a panic attack.
              Justin was the first person to notice the student was having
              difficulties and immediately took steps to ensure they were safe
              and cared for. As on onlooker, I was thankful to know that despite
              the pressure on him to get through the material, Justin choose to
              ensure this student was safe. It is rare one sees a professor make
              such a choice to put students first. Additionally, podcasting
              lectures and not having clicker questions required in every class
              has allowed students the ability to stay home when they are sick.
              Thus, I and my peers were not forced to get one another sick to
              attend lecture and understand the material. As a student, a class
              policy like this demonstrates care for students that can be rare
              at this university. There's more, but overall I really appreciated
              Justin and learned a lot in the course.

              DSC, you were always a professor that allowed me to understand the
              material and was very understanding of any difficulties students
              may face. I took a few courses with you but even when I did not,
              would use what you taught and the resources you provided to help
              me with the other classes. I started off in DSC as a disaster and
              didn't know if I'd make it through but I was able to catch on and
              learn a lot from you so I thank you for having that impact on me.
              I know I am not the only one and you have made an impact on every
              DSC student in a positive way. It was a privilege to learn from

              midterms before taking them again in the final and allows for
              revision of most of your homework, encouraging you to look and
              learn from your mistake. He was very accessible outside of class
              and on campuswire. He also moved our exam during the election so
              we wouldn't have the added stress of all of that work. He would
              move his OH to before exams started which was super useful in case
              you needed it and adjusted homework deadlines so we weren't
              pressed for time. Overall, he's a professor that can perfectly
              portray material and break it down into its basics in order to get
              you to understand and cares more than his students are learning
              than stressing, unlike other professors. I had a great experience

              wanted to reach out because such a big part of my education took
              place in your classes. During my 3 years in the program, I had you
              as a teacher for 5 of my classes (DSC 10, 40B, 80, 190, 140A), and
              it feels as though you shaped me into the data scientist I am
              today. Your classes were the bookends of my time at UCSD (DSC10 in
              my first quarter and 140A in my last quarter)!! I want to express
              my deepest thanks for being such a phenomenal teacher. I always
              appreciated your clear, consistent lecture style, the abundance of
              resources you provided in each class, and how you were always easy
              to reach out to with questions / confusions. It is rare to find
              teachers that make themselves accessible to students, and it is
              much appreciated. I hope you have a wonderful summer, and take a
              well deserved rest! Best, Anjana Sriram HDSI c/o 2023

              Just Eldridge is one of the best professor's at HDSI. This was my
              4th class with him because he commands the material of his
              lectures well and makes it easier for everyone to understand. He
              also is fair about homework assignments and exams and doesn't
              overwork the class.

              Professor Justin is really good, he is super accessible after
              class, and has a lot of knowledge. The best thing about him is
              that he can explain hard concepts really easy. His teaching style
              is good and his humor helps. I would like to see in class more
              examples that he knows (from internet, news, his works).

              Justin is a very knowledgeable lecturer and he does a really good
              job of teaching. He stops often to check our knowledge with
              practice problems and he makes an effort to mention real world
              applications of what we learn in class. I feel that I've learned a
              lot about the theory of data science in the past quarter and I'm
              very happy that I got to have him as an instructor.

              we can all understand (instead of just describing a topic
              unclearly as was done in 40A). His exams and homework all reflect
              the content that is being taught to us. I made sure to pick a
              class with him next quarter. If I could have a class with him in

              Professor Eldridge is one of those rare gem professors and I
              highly encourage the CSE department to keep him. Despite the
              strange quarter that this was, Professor Eldrige adapted quite
              effortlessly to an online setting, if you told me his primary
              source of teaching was online, I wouldn't be surprised. Remote
              teaching asside, he's also quite resourceful. It's evident that he
              took the time to strategically hone in on the "essentials" without
              sacrificing the real world appication of this work through his
              "plus problems". His exams were always fair, reflecting the
              practice we students put into the homework and lecture review.
              He's also swift to provide help to those who have questions or
              concerns about grading, etc. Lastly I'd like to point out that you
              can really tell professor Eldridge empathizes with the students
              and how they're learning. I believe that all the great things I've
              mentioned here boils down to that simple fact: he cares about
              teaching, about his students, and about them learning.

              automatically gives an extension for 24 hours. These policies
              definitely help students especially in this era of online learning
              because of the constant stresses of 2020. I wish more courses in
              data science offered these sorts of policies to help students
              because I think they are fair, and promote learning course
              material as opposed to worrying about grades.

              Professor Eldridge's was truly a breath of fresh air. He really
              understood the difficulties that we students were facing
              throughout this quarter, and especially the end. He was always
              accommodating and willing to listen to everyone. HIGHLY

              dropping the lowest homework, and no-fault redemption exams. He's
              transparent about everything and accommodates any sudden changes
              in situations. By far, one of the best professors in the Data

              cleanest assignments. The fact that questions graded green
              required an explanation for every answer ensured that I had mental
              clarity on the concepts. This was further reinforced by
              "check-offs" which required me to explain what I did wrong in

              Professor Eldridge has been my favorite professor at UCSD so far!
              No other professor puts in this amount of effort, and promotes
              learning as much. His extreme pursuit of clarity in his
              explanations, and well designed course structure are deeply
              appreciated by students. These things are what make the difference
              in the end, and make students enjoy studying. The fact that he was
              able to create such a great course under such tight time
              constraints and during a pandemic is extremely commendable! Thank
              you!

                Before Spring 2020, DSC 40B was taught on the blackboard. I
                redesigned the course over Spring break to follow a format that
                I thought would be more suitable for remote learning: short
                YouTube videos over lecture slides that students could follow
                along with.

              This was an amazing course that allowed for so much growth and
              learning. I was constantly reviewing my previous homework and
              learning from my mistakes allowing me to keep updated on the
              material. Being able to submit regrades encouraged me to learn
              from my mistakes as well as the discussions were incredibly useful
              for the homeworks. I found there aren't enough office hours, but
              it was still doable. I learned a great deal and the professor made
              the material seem so much easier to process.

                limited by the course's budget.

              Professor Eldridge is by far one of the best data science

              What's expected of us is reasonable relative to what we are taught
              and exposed to. The way he teaches provides us material to go back
              and look at previous lectures to better help us complete our
              homeworks. Some data science courses require you to teach yourself
              80\% of the material but with professor Eldridge he teaches most
              of the material. He not only teaches it but teaches is

              Hey Justin, I just wanted to write to congratulate you for winning
              the Outstanding Teaching Award! It's extremely well-deserved and
              I'm really excited to see how the Data Science program will
              continue to grow in the next few years (in the new building!)
              under your oversight! I really wish I made it to Data Science
              graduation! I was on a backpacking trip for 68 days so I didn't
              get a chance to thank you for everything and congratulate you in
              person for your award. I did, however, walk around campus one last
              time and see your picture on a banner near new HDSI!! Thank you so
              much for all your support throughout these past four years.
              Through tutoring DSC 10 for my first time on your team and taking
              your classes, I always felt encouraged and motivated to be a
              better data scientist and person. Best wishes, Yash Potdar P.S.:
              My friends told me you gave a great final lecture on life. Was
              this podcasted by any chance? 🤕😅
