A query in a trie simply walks down $|p|$ nodes of the tree. A hash table, on the other hand, requires hashing the query string in $\\Theta(|p|)$, then must loop through a bucket, performing a string equality check on each entry in the bucket. So the total time taken by a hash table is $\\Theta(|p|) + c \\cdot O(|p|)$, where $c$ is the number of elements in the bucket which appear before the query string.\n",

For one, Python hash tables are *super* optimized. The $\\Theta(|p|)$ work needed to hash the string is done in C, while the $\\Theta(|p|)$ work done by the trie is in a pure Python loop and involves a lot of indirection. If we wanted to make trie membership query more competitive, we'd need to implement our trie in a lower-level language (C, Rust, etc.). The hash table is plenty fast."
