<h2 id="topics">Topics</h2>
<p>This week, we'll collect a massive data set of ~2 million tweets on COVID.</p>
<h3 id="readings-and-tasks">Readings and Tasks</h3>
<p>To study the spread of misinformation about COVID-19, we'll gather a collection
of around 2 million tweets. The <a href="http://www.panacealab.org/covid19/">Panacea
Lab</a> at Georgia State University has been
collecting tweets about the coronavirus since the beginning of the pandemic.
These tweets are provided in the form of Tweet ID, and it is up to us to
"rehydrate" the tweets.</p>
<p>The Panacea Lab attempts to collect <em>every</em> tweet about COVID. As a result,
the full data set contains, on average, 4.4 million tweets <em>per day</em>. This is
way too many tweets for us, so we will need to choose a random subset of them to
hydrate. When doing so, you should sample <em>uniformly at random</em>, and as a result
the distribution of tweet dates in your sampled data should be about the same as
the population distribution.</p>
<p>There are two tasks this week, each very open-ended in that you'll need to make
some decisions on how to fill in the details in a reasonable way:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hydrate a data set of (roughly) 2 million tweets from the period of February
   15, 2020 to October 10, 2021. The only constraints are that you 1) use the
   "normal" data (as opposed to the "clean" data), as it includes re-tweets, and
   2) you sample uniformly at random.</li>
<li>Once you have your data set of 2 million tweets, estimate the proportion of
   them that contain links (URLs).</li>
</ol>
<p>These tasks might be harder than they first appear! Even getting the tweet IDs
involves a few challenges. For instance, you could get them from the GitHub repo
provided by the Panacea Lab, but they are broken into daily files -- you'd need
to write a script to download each of them one-at-a-time and sample.
Alternatively, you could download the <em>entire</em> data set of tweet IDs (the
Panacea Lab provides a few links), but it is a single 10 GB file that may not
fit in your computer's memory.</p>
<p>Make your best effort at completing this by Wednesday. When we meet, we'll
discuss the challenges you might have faced and talk about possible solutions.</p>
<p>For this week's participation, we'll use the "default" participation questions
for a task.</p>
