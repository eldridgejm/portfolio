                        <h2>Required Materials</h2>

                        There is no required textbook for the class. Instead, we'll
                        use <a href="resources.html#notes">course notes</a>.
                        You will need an iClicker to participate in lecture; your
                        iClicker responses will be used to assign you tokens
                        for <a href="#tokens">attendance</a>. You can register
                        your iClicker using the link on this course's <a
                        href="http://canvas.ucsd.edu">Canvas</a> page (we won't
                        use Canvas for anything else).

                        <h2>Message Board</h2>

                        We'll use 
                        <a href="https://campuswire.com/c/GF22AE928/feed" target="_blank">Campuswire</a>
                        as the course message board. I'll post all announcements there, so make sure you have access.
                        You can also ask (and answer) questions about course topics and message other people in the class.
                    </div>

                    <div class="section">

                        <h2>Tokens</h2>

                        <p>
                            Many courses have separate, strict policies for
                            attendance and late homeworks. Instead, DSC 40A is
                            flexible: it allows you to build your own policy.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            At the beginning of the quarter, you are given
                            two <b>tokens</b>.  At the end of the quarter,
                            these tokens can be used to turn late homeworks
                            into on-time homeworks, and to add points to your
                            homework score.  Here's the twist: additional
                            tokens can be earned throughout the quarter by
                            attending lecture.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Here's how it works: for every four lectures you
                            attend, you earn one extra token (attendance is
                            taken using the clicker discussion questions).
                            There are 18 total lectures, so if you attend every
                            lecture you'll get 4 extra tokens. Combined with
                            the 2 you get at the beginning of the quarter,
                            you'll end up with 6 tokens.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            At the very end of the quarter, I'll check to see
                            which of your homeworks were submitted within the
                            late period (24 hours after the due date). 
                            Each token you have will be automatically used to
                            flip one "late" homework to "on-time".
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            If you have tokens left after this, they'll automatically
                            go towards boosting your homework score. Here's the conversion
                            rate:

                                <tr>
                                    <td>4<sup>th</sup> leftover token</td>
                                    <td> +10 points </td>

                                    <td> +10 points </td>
                                </tr>
                                <tr>
                                    <td>6<sup>th</sup> leftover token</td>
                                    <td> +5 points </td>
                                </tr>
                            </table>
                            </center>

                            These points are added to the total number of points you earned over all homeworks
                            (there will be around 800 points available), up to a
                            maximum of full credit (you can't get more than a
                            100% on your homework).
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            You don't have to do anything to use your tokens &mdash; I'll apply
                            them automatically at the end of the quarter.
                        </p>


                        <p>
                            <h3>Example 1: the person who skips every class.</h3>

                            Zelda attends only one lecture &mdash; the first one
                            &mdash; and turns in one homework late. At the end of
                            the quarter she'll have two tokens. One will go towards
                            negating her late homework, the other will add 50
                            points to her homework total.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        <h3>Example 2: the person who is always late.</h3>
                            Winona attends every class, but turns in all of her
                            homeworks late. She gets six tokens for attendance, and
                            six of her late homeworks are considered on-time, but
                            she has no points added to her homework total. Moreover,
                            one of her homeworks receives a zero, because it was late and
                            she didn't have enough tokens to mark it as on-time.

                        <h2>Grading Scheme</h2>

                        <p>
                            Your final grade will be calculated using the following breakdown:
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>25% Homework</li>
                                <li>30% maximum of Midterm 01 and Midterm 01 Redemption
                                <li>30% maximum of Midterm 02 and Midterm 02 Redemption
                                <li>15% Final Exam
                            </ul>

                        <p>
                            Midterm 01 will cover lectures 1&mdash;7, Midterm 02
                            will cover lectures 8&mdash;14, and the Final Exam will
                            cover lectures 15&mdash;18.  However, the final exam
                            will also have two, optional <b>redemption</b> sections
                            which will allow you to completely replace your midterm
                            scores.  Each redemption section will be similar in
                            length to the midterm it is replacing, but there's no
                            guarantee that it will be the same level of difficulty.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Letter grades will be assigned using the
                            traditional scale (e.g., a 93% and above is an A, a
                            90% to a 93% is an A-, etc.). Minor adjustments to
                            the scale may be made only after all
                            grades are computed; these will never result in your grade decreasing.

                        <p>
                            All of your grades will be available on

                        <h2>Regrades</h2>

                        You can ask for a regrade on any assignment if you
                        believe that the grader made a mistake.  Remember that
                        clarity is a part of your score &mdash; if you had the
                        right idea but were unable to clearly communicate it,
                        you may still not deserve full credit. We ask that you
                        please submit your regrade requests within one week
                        of the assignment being released.
