    getting started
</h2>

<p>To get started in CSE 151A, you'll need to set up accounts on a couple of
websites.</p>
<h4 id="campuswire">campuswire</h4>
<p>We'll be using <a href="https://campuswire.com/c/GD09972CF" target="_blank">Campuswire</a>
as our course message board. Campuswire is like
Piazza, but unlike Piazza, Campuswire does not sell student data to third
parties.</p>
<p>You should have received an invitation via email, but if not you can manually
<a href="https://campuswire.com/p/GD09972CF">join our class</a> with the entry code <code>7739</code>.</p>
<p>I'll be making all announcements via Campuswire posts, so make sure that you
register ASAP.</p>
<h4 id="gradescope">gradescope</h4>
<p>We'll be using <a href="https://www.gradescope.com/courses/107291">gradescope</a> for
homework submission and grading. If you haven't used Gradescope before,
the process is pretty simple: you complete your homework however you'd like (by
writing your answers on a piece of paper, typing them up, using a tablet, etc.).
You then upload a scan of your answers (an image taken from a phone will do just
fine) and select which part of your image corresponds to which question.
See their <a href="https://www.gradescope.com/help#help-center-section-student-workflow">help
center</a>
for more.</p>
<p>You should have received an email invitation for Gradescope, but if not, you can
join using the access code <code>92YJDK</code>.</p>
<h4 id="zoom">zoom</h4>
<p>Some aspects of the course, like office hours and discussion, will be held using
Zoom. You should already have an account through UCSD; see the <a href="https://edtech.ucsd.edu/education-continuity-tools-and-resources/zoom-guides.html">Zoom
guide</a>
for more help. Note that you will <strong>not</strong> be expected to have a webcam!</p>
<h4 id="canvas">canvas</h4>
<p>We'll use canvas for the course gradebook. Our course's Canvas page will also link
directly to <a href="http://cse151a.com">cse151a.com</a>, so every aspect of the course can
be accessed via Canvas. Or, if you'd like, you can avoid Canvas entirely.</p>
<h2 id="materials">
<i class="em em-card_file_box" aria-role="presentation" aria-label=""></i>
&nbsp;
required materials
</h2>

<p>No materials are required for this course; we'll use online video lectures as
the main resource. That said, here are some books that you might find useful;
the first is freely available as a PDF:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman, 
  <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/"><em>The elements of statistical learning (2nd edition)</em></a>.</li>
<li>Gilbert Strang, <em>Linear algebra and its applications</em>.</li>
<li>Kevin Murphy, <em>Machine learning: a probabilistic perspective</em>.</li>
<li>Richard Duda, Peter Hart, and David Stork, <em>Pattern classification (2nd edition)</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will <strong>not</strong> need a webcam, but you'll need a way to access the internet and
to upload pictures of your homework. If you foresee this being problematic
&mdash; or you find that you're unable to fully participate in the class for any
reason &mdash; send me a message on Campuswire and
we'll figure it out.</p>
<h2 id="lectures">
<i class="em em-male-teacher" aria-role="presentation" aria-label=""></i>
&nbsp;
lectures and "watch parties"
</h2>

<p>CSE 151A is entirely online this quarter due to the <i class="em em-microbe"
aria-role="presentation" aria-label="MICROBE"></i>. As such, our lectures will
be <strong>video lectures</strong>.
There will be two video lectures per week. These lectures will be pre-recorded
and posted on the front page of this website
(<a href="http://cse151a.com">cse151a.com</a>).  You will be able to watch them whenever is
most convenient for you.  I highly recommend that you watch each video, but
doing so (or not doing so) won't affect your grade.</p>
<p>Video lectures have a lot of benefits over "traditional" lectures — you can
pause them, rewind them, and speed them up, for instance. But there's no
equivalent of "raising your hand" and getting an immediate like there is in a
usual lecture.</p>
<p>We're going to try and address this with <strong>watch parties</strong>. A watch party is a
designated time where you can watch the video lectures <em>and</em> be guaranteed a
quick answer to any questions that pop up as you watch.</p>
<p>Here is how it works: start watching your video lecture at around 3:00 PM PST on
Monday or Wednesday (the normal time scheduled for CSE 151A's lecture). If you
have a question about the lecture, post it to Campuswire. I (or one of the TAs)
will answer it ASAP. After the watch party, we'll collate all of the questions
that were asked into a pinned Campuswire post, so even if you miss the watch
party you can see what questions other people had and how they were answered.</p>
<h2 id="discussions">
<i class="em em-raised_hand_with_fingers_splayed" aria-role="presentation" aria-label=""></i>
&nbsp;
discussions
</h2>

<p>We will have weekly, hour-long <strong>discussion</strong> sections focusing on solving problems.
Discussion will be held on Fridays at 3:00 PM PST via Zoom (note! this is
different from the scheduled discussion time, but it takes the place of Friday's lecture).
A weekly discussion worksheet will be posted before discussion. During
discussion, you'll work together with classmates on solving these problems.</p>
<p>Virtual attendance in discussion section is recommended, but not required.
We'll record the discussion and post the link on the front page of the course
site.</p>
<h2 id="office-hours">
<i class="em em-hourglass_flowing_sand" aria-role="presentation" aria-label="HOURGLASS WITH FLOWING SAND"></i>
&nbsp;
office hours
</h2>

<p>We will hold office hours over Zoom. Please see the <a href="./office_hours.html">office hours</a> page for
the schedule and for instructions.</p>

&nbsp;
pass/no pass and letter grades
</h2>

<p>In <a href="http://adminrecords.ucsd.edu/Notices/2020/2020-3-24-1.html">this letter</a>,
the university announced that it is relaxing the constraints on taking classes
on a P/NP (pass/no pass) basis for Spring 2020. Here is the relevant part of
that letter:</p>
<div class="alert alert-light border">
Courses taken in Spring 2020 will be exempt from the 25% limit on the number of
UC San Diego units that undergraduates may complete on a P/NP basis. The
deadline for registering to take a course on a P/NP (or S/U) basis will be the
end of week 10. The deadline for adding undergraduate or graduate courses will
be the end of week three. Certain drop/withdrawal deadlines have been pushed
later; others remain on their original schedules.
</div>

<p>You should definitely consider taking this class P/NP, but it might not be a
simple decision:</p>
<div class="alert alert-danger">
Even though the university has relaxed the constraints on P/NP, that doesn't
affect how people *outside* of the university think of P/NP.  If someone looks
over your grades in the future &mdash; for instance, someone on a grad school
admissions panel &mdash; hopefully they'll remember that a global health
crisis was occurring in Spring 2020 and that taking the class P/NP shouldn't be
interpreted negatively.

If in doubt, discuss your future plans with your advisor before electing to take
the class P/NP.
</div>

<p>Luckily, you don't have to decide whether to take the class P/NP or for a letter
grade until the end of Week 10. To make this decision easier for you, I'm doing
the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>All grades except for the final exam will be in before the Week 10 deadline,
   so you'll have a very good idea of your letter grade before you
   have to make a decision. Furthermore, the final exam will only be a small
   part of your overall grade.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The grading scheme is designed so that it is very clear what must be done in
   order to receive a grade of P for the class, but it is also accommodating of
   people who want to earn a high letter grade, like an A or B+.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You don't need to tell me whether you're taking the class P/NP or for a letter
grade &mdash; you tell the registrar, and I'll submit your grade accordingly at
the end of the quarter.</p>
<h2 id="homeworks">
<i class="em em-house_with_garden" aria-role="presentation" aria-label="HOUSE WITH GARDEN"></i>
&nbsp;
homeworks and "check-offs"
</h2>

<p>Your grade in this class will come from two types of assessments: homeworks and
exams. But the homeworks and exams in this quarter's version of CSE 151A might
be a little different than what you are used to. That's because a large number
of students will be taking this class P/NP. The grading scheme and assessments
are designed to reflect that.</p>
<p>Homework problems will be a mixture of theory and practice. There will be
problems that require you to write code, but you'll be able to use whatever
language you prefer.</p>
<h4 id="essential-and-plus-problems">"essential" and "plus" problems</h4>
<p>Each homework problem falls into one of two possible categories: it is either an
"essential" problem, or it is a "plus" problem. Essential problems are
mandatory; everyone, regardless of whether they are taking the class P/NP or for
a letter grade, must attempt every essential problem. But the plus problems
are optional. It is by attempting the plus problems that you can get a high
letter grade in the course; see <a href="#grading">grading</a> below for how.</p>
<p>The essential problems and plus problems differ in how they are graded.
Essential problems are graded on a color scale:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <span class="text-success font-weight-bold">Green</span>: You had the right idea,
        and you get credit for the problem.
    </li>
    <li>
        <span class="text-warning font-weight-bold">Yellow</span>: Your approach
        showed effort, but wasn't right. You'll need to meet with a tutor or TA
        to get your answer "checked-off", at which point it will be regraded to
        <span class="text-success font-weight-bold">Green</span>. See <a
        href="#check-offs">check-offs</a> below for more on the process.
    </li>
    <li>
        <span class="text-danger font-weight-bold">Red</span>: You didn't answer
        the problem, or showed no work. No credit is awarded and you are not
        eligible for a check-off.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>At the end of the quarter, almost all of your solutions to essential problems
must be marked <span class="text-success font-weight-bold">Green</span> (either
by getting the problem correct or by checking it off with a tutor) in order to
pass the class. See <a href="#grading">grading</a> below for specifics.</p>
<p>"Plus" problems, on the other hand, are graded with partial credit on a
traditional point scale, with some problems being worth more than others. In
order to receive an A, you'll need to earn above a certain number of points on
plus problems throughout the quarter.
See <a href="#grading">grading</a> below for specifics.</p>
<h4 id="check-offs">"check-offs"</h4>
<p>Suppose you have incorrectly answered an "essential" problem, and it was marked
<span class="text-warning font-weight-bold">Yellow</span>. You <strong>must</strong> get your
solution checked-off by a tutor within <strong>one week</strong> of your assignment being returned.</p>
<p>To get a 
<span class="text-warning font-weight-bold">Yellow</span> solution checked-off:</p>
<ol>
<li>Review your answer to find your mistake, comparing it to the solutions posted
   on the course webpage.</li>
<li>Submit a <a href="https://www.gradescope.com/help#help-center-item-student-regrades">regrade
   request</a>
   for the problem on Gradescope. In your regrade request, identify your mistake
   and what you would need to do to correct it. You don't need to go into a ton
   of detail here; three or four sentences should do it.</li>
<li>A grader will review your request within a week (as long as you submit it
   within a week of the homework scores being posted, your regrade request will
   be reviewed). If you aren't able to identify what you did incorrectly, you'll
   be asked to attend a grader's office hours in order to discuss the problem in
   more detail.</li>
</ol>
<p>Check-offs aren't punishments; they're designed to get quick, targeted feedback
to those who need it.</p>
<p>Warning! If your <span class="text-warning font-weight-bold">Yellow</span> solution isn't
checked-off within a week of receiving your grade, it will automatically lapse
to <span class="text-danger font-weight-bold">Red</span>.</p>
<h4 id="slip-days">slip days</h4>
<p>You have four "slip days" to use throughout the quarter. A slip day extends the
deadline of any one homework by 24 hours. Slip days can't be "stacked" &mdash;
the latest any one homework can be submitted is 24 hours after the deadline.
Slip days are applied automatically at the end of the quarter, but it's your
responsibility to keep track of how many you have left.</p>
<h4 id="frequency-and-due-dates">frequency and due dates</h4>
<p>There will be eight homeworks. Each homework will be due via
<a href="#gradescope">Gradescope</a> at 11:59 PM on the Wednesday after it is assigned.</p>
<h4 id="collaboration">collaboration</h4>
<p>You may discuss the homework problems with other people, but you must turn in
your original work. Sharing "big-picture" ideas about how to solve problems is
fine; sharing the details or complete solutions is not. If you submit a solution
that looks substantially the same as another person's, you're putting yourself
at risk of an Academic Integrity report.</p>
<p>Here's a rule of thumb to help you decide if your mode of collaboration is OK:
wait an hour after discussing a problem to write down your answer. If you're
having trouble, that means you might not fully understand the solution.</p>
<h4 id="regrade-requests">regrade requests</h4>
<p>If you feel that the grader has made a mistake, you may submit a regrade request
via Gradescope within <strong>one week</strong> of the grades being released. Note that part
of your grade is clarity, so if your answer was mostly right but unclear you may
still not deserve full credit.</p>
<p>To get an "essential" problem regraded, don't use the normal regrade request
mechanism on Gradescope. Instead, follow the procedure to get your solution
<a href="#check-offs">"checked-off"</a></p>
<h2 id="exams">
<i class="em em-writing_hand" aria-role="presentation" aria-label=""></i>
&nbsp;
exams
</h2>

<p>There will be two midterms and one final exam, held on the following dates:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Midterm 01</strong>: Friday, May 1 (covers weeks 01 &mdash; 04)</li>
<li><strong>Midterm 02</strong>: Friday, May 29 (covers weeks 05 &mdash; 08)</li>
<li><strong>Final Exam</strong>: Wednesday, June 10</li>
</ul>
<p>The exams will be online and delivered via Canvas quiz or similar. There will be
a window of 24 hours during which you can start your exam, but once your exam is
started you will have a limited amount of time to finish it: 1.5 hours for each midterm
and <strike>4 hours for the final exam</strike>
<span class="text-danger">(
<span class="badge badge-danger">Update</span>
Due to a university rule, online exams cannot exceed 3 hours. As a result, I'm
going to reduce the amount of content on the final exam redemption sections and
allow a total of 1.5 hours for each).</span> The window will open at 00:00 Pacific Standard
Time on the day listed above, and will end at 23:59 Pacific Standard Time.</p>
<p>The exams will be designed to test your knowledge of the "essential" parts of
the class. They will consist of 20 to 30 multiple-choice, true/false, or short
answer questions that should each take a minute or two to read and solve.</p>
<p>In a "traditional" quarter, exams are the "main event", and the purpose of
homework is to prepare you for the exam. In this quarter, the homeworks are the
main assessment, and the purpose of the exams is to verify that your performance
on the homework is a good signal of your understanding. As such, the best way to
prepare for the exams will be to review the "essential" homework problems and
make sure that the solutions make sense to you.</p>
<h4 id="redemption">Redemption</h4>
<p>The final exam will be split into three parts:</p>
<ol>
<li><strike>The mandatory final exam section, covering weeks 09 and 10.</strike> 
<span class="text-danger">
(
<span class="badge badge-danger">Update</span>
There will be no mandatory section.)
</span></li>
<li>An optional Midterm 01 Redemption section</li>
<li>An optional Midterm 02 Redemption section</li>
</ol>
<p>If your score on the midterm redemption section is higher than your score on the
original midterm, it will replace that grade. Getting a lower score on a
redemption section cannot hurt you (but it will make me sad). As a consequence,
the redemption sections are optional.</p>
<h2 id="grading">
<i class="em em-100" aria-role="presentation" aria-label="HUNDRED POINTS SYMBOL"></i>
&nbsp;
grading scheme
</h2>

<p>There will be no overall "score" in this class that determines your final grade.
Instead, the grade that you'll receive will depend on satisfying certain
conditions. This is designed so that it is very clear what needs to be done in
order to receive a P grade if you are taking the class P/NP.</p>
<h4 id="pnp">P/NP</h4>
<p>Here is what you'll have to do in order to pass the class, if you are taking the
class P/NP:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have <strong>at most</strong> four essential homework problems with <span class="text-danger font-weight-bold">Red</span> grades at the end of the quarter.</li>
<li>Receive at least a 70% on <strong>both</strong> of the midterms (or the redemption
  sections).</li>
<li><strike>Receive at least a 50% on the final exam mandatory section.</strike></li>
</ul>
<p>You must meet each of the above conditions to pass; otherwise you'll receive a
grade of NP.</p>
<p>Remember that 
<span class="text-warning font-weight-bold">Yellow</span> homework scores lapse
to <span class="text-danger font-weight-bold">Red</span> unless you get them
<a href="#check-offs">checked-off</a>, in which case they turn to <span class="text-success
font-weight-bold">Green</span>.</p>
<h4 id="letter-grading">Letter Grading</h4>
<p>Here is how your grade will be calculated if you elect the letter grade option.
Each letter grade requires a certain level of performance on both the exams and
the homework. Here are the requirements for exams:</p>
<table class="table">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th scope="col">

            </td>

    </tbody>
</table>

<p>For homeworks, you must have <strong>at most</strong> four essential homework problems with
<span class="text-danger font-weight-bold">Red</span> grades at the end of the
quarter to receive a letter grade higher than an F.</p>
<p>You can also earn a higher grade by correctly completing the "plus" problems on
each homework. Here is number of plus points you'll need to earn over the course
of the quarter in order to receive each letter grade:</p>

<p>I'll guarantee that at least 80 "plus points" will be available throughout the
quarter, but I might offer more. The requirements listed above are <em>absolute</em>,
meaning that, for instance, earning 50 plus points gets you a B+, whether
80 points are available or 180.</p>
<p>In order to receive a certain letter grade, you must satisfy <strong>both</strong> the exam
and homework requirements for that grade. Another way of putting this is that
you'll receive the <strong>lower</strong> of the exam letter grade and the homework letter
grade.</p>
<h5 id="example">Example</h5>
<p>Suppose I get an 85% on both of my midterms and a 90% on the
final; this puts me into the "B-/B/B+" category for the exam grade. Then suppose
I earn 80 "plus points", putting me into the "A" category for the homework
grade. My overall letter grade will be a "B+", since I didn't meet the exam
requirements for an "A".</p>

illnesses and extenuating circumstances
</h2>

<p>Because of the pandemic, we must prepare for the unfortunate possibility that
you will get sick and be unable to participate in this class for long periods of
time.  The university has a mechanism for helping in this situation: the
<strong>Incomplete</strong>. If you are unable to complete the course because of reasons
outside of your control, you may be given an Incomplete instead of a letter
grade or a P/NP. This simply means that you will complete the rest of the work
at a later time. Once you have done so, your overall grade is calculated and
your Incomplete grade is replaced.</p>
<div class="alert alert-danger"> 
An Incomplete does not allow you to re-do work that has already been completed,
only to do work that hasn't been completed.
</div>

<p>Unfortunately, your personal health is not the only think that might prevent
you from participating in this class. Some of us will get sick, others will have
family members fall ill, and others might lose their jobs. If you have
any doubt about your ability to perform satisfactorily in this course due to
something outside of your control, <strong>please contact me ASAP</strong> and we'll figure
something out.</p>

frequently asked questions
</h2>

<h4 id="do-i-need-a-webcam-for-this-class">Do I need a webcam for this class?</h4>
<p>Nope! If you have one, you're welcome to use it; it can be especially useful to
share your work during office hours. But we won't require webcams. In
particular, we are <strong>not</strong> using proctoring services like examity.</p>
<h4 id="why-is-it-not-possible-to-earn-a-letter-grade-of-d">Why is it not possible to earn a letter grade of D?</h4>
<p>At UCSD, a grade of C- or higher corresponds to a P (pass), and anything lower than
a C- corresponds to a NP (not pass). As such, I've made the requirements for a C- the
same as the requirements for a P.</p>
<h4 id="do-i-need-to-tell-you-if-im-taking-the-class-pnp-or-for-a-letter-grade">Do I need to tell you if I'm taking the class P/NP or for a letter grade?</h4>
<p>You don't need to tell me whether you're taking the class P/NP or for a letter
grade &mdash; you tell the registrar, and I'll submit your grade accordingly at
the end of the quarter.</p>
<h4 id="what-happens-if-the-professor-gets-sick-and-cant-run-the-course">What happens if the professor gets sick and can't run the course?</h4>
<p>We've prepared for this possibility in a couple of ways. Namely:</p>
<ol>
<li>"Backup" faculty have been selected who are ready to take over the course.</li>
<li>All grades will be stored in Canvas so that they are accessible to the
   university.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="why-should-i-try-for-a-letter-grade-if-i-can-just-take-the-class-pnp">Why should I try for a letter grade if I can just take the class P/NP?</h4>
<p>First, remember that even though the university has relaxed the constraints on
P/NP, that doesn't affect how people <em>outside</em> of the university think of P/NP.
<em>If</em> someone looks over your grades in the future, hopefully they'll remember
that a global health crisis was occurring in Spring 2020 and that taking the
class P/NP shouldn't be interpreted negatively. </p>
<p>But secondly, I've purposely designed the grading scale so that getting a grade
of B+, A-, or A is very attainable. For example, to get a B+ score on your
homework, you only need to earn 50 plus points when there are at least 80
available.</p>
<h4 id="since-lecture-is-online-there-is-no-physical-limitation-on-class-size-so-we-can-let-everybody-in-off-the-waitlist-right">Since lecture is online, there is no physical limitation on class size. So we can let everybody in off the waitlist, right?</h4>
<p>We don't have a classroom size limitation, but we only have so many tutors/TAs
(and I don't think we can hire more at this point). That's the real limitation.
If we scaled the class up without also scaling the number of TAs, I think we'd
get overwhelmed.  That said, all of my materials are going to be publicly
available on cse151a.com, so if you're unable to make it in off the waitlist you
can at least audit the class!</p>
