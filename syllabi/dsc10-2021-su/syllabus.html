<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started &nbsp; <i class="em em-passenger_ship" aria-role="presentation" aria-label=""></i></h2>
<p>To get started in DSC 10, you'll need to set up accounts on a couple of
websites.</p>
<h4 id="campuswire">Campuswire</h4>
<p>We'll be using <a href="https://campuswire.com/c/GB6F5E8BE/feed">Campuswire</a>
as our course message board. Campuswire is like
Piazza, but unlike Piazza, Campuswire does not sell student data to third
parties. You should have received an invitation via email, but if not you should get in
touch with a course staff member as soon as possible, as we'll be making all
course announcements via Campuswire.</p>
<p>If you have a question about anything to do with the course  &mdash; if you're stuck on a
homework problem, want clarification on the logistics, or just have a general question
about data science &mdash; you can make a post on Campuswire. We only ask that if your
question includes some or all of an answer, please make your post <strong>private</strong> so that
others cannot see it. You can also post anonymously if you would prefer.</p>
<p>Course staff will regularly check Campuswire and try to answer any questions that you
have. You're also encouraged to answer a question asked by another student if you
feel that you know the answer.</p>
<h4 id="gradescope">Gradescope</h4>
<p>We'll be using 
<a href="https://www.gradescope.com/courses/277462">Gradescope</a> for
homework submission and grading. Most of the assignments will be a mixture of math and
coding, and the coding parts are usually autograded via Gradescope.,
You should have received an email invitation for Gradescope, but if not please
let us know as soon as possible (preferably via Campuswire).</p>
<h4 id="zoom">Zoom</h4>
<p>Some aspects of the course, like office hours and the remote discussion, will be held using
Zoom. You should already have an account through UCSD; see the <a href="https://edtech.ucsd.edu/education-continuity-tools-and-resources/zoom-guides.html">Zoom
guide</a>
for more help. Note that you will <strong>not</strong> be expected to have a webcam!</p>
<h4 id="canvas">Canvas</h4>
<p>We'll use <a href="canvas.ucsd.edu">Canvas</a> for the course gradebook and for the exams.</p>
<h4 id="required-materials">Required Materials</h4>
<p>We'll be using DSC 10's own textbook, <a href="https://eldridgejm.github.io/dive_into_data_science/front.html">Dive into Data
Science</a>. This
textbook is a work-in-progress, so please let us know if you spot any errors or
have any suggestions.</p>
<p>You will not need a webcam for DSC 10.</p>
<h2 id="lectures">Lectures &nbsp; <i class="em em-male-teacher" aria-role="presentation" aria-label=""></i></h2>
<p>DSC 10 is entirely online this quarter due to the <i class="em em-microbe"
aria-role="presentation" aria-label="MICROBE"></i>.
As such, lectures will be pre-recorded and posted on YouTube.
Since the summer session is a condensed version of a normal quarter, there will
be <strong>four</strong> lectures per week, each 1.5 hours long. The lectures, along with
all other materials for the week, will be posted on the course website at the
start of the week.</p>
<p>Although the lectures will be pre-recorded, we will be hosting a large number
of <a href="./office_hours.md">office hours</a> via Zoom. Feel free to drop by one of these 
hours to ask questions about the lecture.</p>
<h2 id="discussions">Discussions &nbsp; <i class="em em-raised_hand_with_fingers_splayed" aria-role="presentation" aria-label=""></i></h2>
<p>Discussions will be held live on Zoom at
01:00 pm PST on Thursday.
It will be recorded for those who are unable to attend.
The Zoom meeting link for the discussion will be available on the front page of the
course website, and a discussion notebook will be posted beforehand.
Virtual attendance in discussion section is recommended, but not required.  We'll record
the discussion and post the link on the front page of the course site.</p>
<h2 id="office-hours">Office Hours &nbsp; <i class="em em-hourglass_flowing_sand" aria-role="presentation" aria-label="HOURGLASS WITH FLOWING SAND"></i></h2>
<p>Course staff, including tutors, TAs, and instructors, will hold office hours
regularly throughout the week. This quarter, all office hours will be via Zoom.
Please see the <a href="./office_hours.html">office hours</a> page for
the schedule and for instructions.</p>
<h2 id="homeworks-labs-and-projects">Homeworks, Labs, and Projects &nbsp; <i class="em em-house_with_garden" aria-role="presentation" aria-label="HOUSE WITH GARDEN"></i></h2>
<p>There are three types of assignments in this class: labs, homeworks, and
projects. All assignments are completed in Jupyter notebooks on
<a href="http://datahub.ucsd.edu">DataHub</a>.</p>
<h3 id="labs">Labs</h3>
<p>Labs are coding assignments designed to help you build the skills needed
to complete the homeworks.</p>
<p>Because this is a condensed summer session, there will be two labs due each
week. The first lab will cover content from the first two lectures of the week,
and the second lab will cover content from the second two lectures.</p>
<p>While completing the lab, you will be able to run a sequence of "tests" which
check to make sure that your answers are correct. If all of the tests pass, you
will get full credit!</p>
<p>Each person must submit each lab on their own, but you are welcome to
collaborate with any number of other students. This means that you can be
discuss the labs with others, you cannot copy or share answers with other
students. Labs are submitted to Gradescope.</p>
<h3 id="homeworks">Homeworks</h3>
<p>Homeworks are similar in format to the labs, but more challenging.  One key
difference between homeworks and labs is that the tests in homeworks only check
to make sure that your answer is reasonable; they do not make sure that it is
correct. Homeworks will generally be assigned weekly, with some exceptions.</p>
<p>You may work on homework assignments and projects either alone or with a
partner, by <em>pair programming</em>. This means that you should work on the
assignment together, discussing each problem together, and writing each answer
together.
If working with a partner, you should submit the assignment as a team on 
Gradescope (ask a classmate or a tutor if you are unsure how to do this).</p>
<h3 id="projects">Projects</h3>
<p>Projects are similar in format to homeworks, but more challenging. They are
somewhat longer than a typical homework, and they require you to pull together
ideas from the previous weeks, rather than just the last week.  There are two
projects: a midterm project, and a final project. You may work together with a
partner on the projects.  If working with a partner, you should submit one
assignment as a team (ask a classmate or a tutor if you are unsure how to do
this).</p>
<h3 id="deadlines-and-slip-days">Deadlines and "Slip Days"</h3>
<p>Homework assignments and projects must be submitted by the 11:59pm deadline to
be considered on time. You may turn them in as many times as you like before the
deadline, and only the most recent submission will be graded, so it's a good
habit to submit early and often.</p>
<p>You have <strike>five</strike> six <strong>slip days</strong> to use throughout throughout
the quarter. A slip day extends the deadline of any one homework, project, or
lab by 24 hours. Slip days cannot be "stacked" or "combined" to extend the
deadline further &mdash; the latest any one homework can be submitted is 24
hours after the deadline.  Slip days are applied automatically at the end of the
quarter, but it's your responsibility to keep track of how many you have left.</p>
<p>Slip days are designed to be a transparent and predictable source of leniency in
deadlines. They're also meant to simplify the process of granting extensions --
keeping track of exceptions in a class of 100+ gets hectic fast!  You can use a
slip day if you are too busy to complete an assignment on its original due date
(or if you forgot about it). But slips days are also meant for things like a
minor illness (a cold that lasts a day) or  the internet crashing at 11:58 PM
just as you go to submit your homework. Slip days are to be used in exceptional
circumstances, so you probably shouldn't get close to using all of them — if you
feel that you will need that many, send me a message and we'll figure something
out.</p>
<p>Slip days aren't meant for emergencies, such as serious illnesses. In such cases
that something outside of your control causes you to miss deadlines, send me an
email and we can plan on how to make up the work.</p>
<h2 id="exams">Exams &nbsp; <i class="em em-writing_hand" aria-role="presentation" aria-label=""></i></h2>
<p>There will be one midterms and one final exam, held on the following dates:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Midterm</strong>: 12:00 pm PST on Wednesday 
    (covers lectures 01 -- 07)</li>
<li><strong>Final Exam</strong>: 12:00 pm PST on Saturday
    (cumulative)</li>
</ul>
<p>The exams will be online and delivered via Canvas quiz or similar. There will be
a window of 24 hours during which you can start your exam, but once your exam is
started you will have a limited amount of time to finish it: 1.5 hours for the midterm
and 3 hours for the final exam.</p>
<h2 id="grading-scheme">Grading Scheme &nbsp; <i class="em em-100" aria-role="presentation" aria-label="HUNDRED POINTS SYMBOL"></i></h2>
<p>We'll be using the following grading scheme:</p>
<ul>
<li>25%:  Homework Assignments (lowest dropped)</li>
<li>20%: Lab Assignments (lowest dropped)</li>
<li>5%:  Project One</li>
<li>10%: Project Two</li>
<li>10%:  Midterm Exam</li>
<li>30%:  Final Exam</li>
</ul>
<p>You must score at least 55% on the final exam to pass the course.  If you score
lower than 55% on the final, you will receive an F in the course, regardless of
your overall average.</p>
<p>The class isn't typically curved. At the end of the quarter, I will run an
algorithm to automatically find the best cutoffs for each letter grade, but
these cutoffs can only be lowered. For instance, a 93% will always be an A.
The grade of "A+" is assigned to people who otherwise receive an "A" and who
distinguish themselves -- for example, by answering questions asked by others on
Campuswire, or by receiving exceptionally high averages across assignments.</p>
<h2 id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently Asked Questions &nbsp; <i class="em em-question" aria-role="presentation" aria-label="HUNDRED POINTS SYMBOL"></i></h2>
<h4 id="will-more-seats-be-added-what-are-my-chances-of-getting-off-of-the-wait-list">Will more seats be added / what are my chances of getting off of the wait list?</h4>
<p>Unfortunately, even though the class is remote, we have a limited number of
seats; While we are no longer constrained by the classroom size, we are
constrained by the size of the course staff and its capacity for grading and
office hours. I understandably receive a few emails every quarter asking about
the chances of making it off of the waitlist, but unfortunately I do not have a
good way of predicting this as I do not have control over the waitlist.</p>
<h4 id="what-does-dropping-the-lowest-homework-mean">What does "dropping the lowest homework" mean?</h4>
<p>"Dropping the lowest" refers to removing the assignment that will result in the largest
boost to your overall score at the end of the quarter. If all assignments are worth the
same amount of points, then the "lowest" is simply the one with the lowest score.
However, if the assignments are worth differing amounts of points, "dropping the lowest"
is not so straightforward. For example, suppose there are three assignments worth 5
points, 100 points, and 15 points, respectively. You score 1/5, 50/100, and 15/15. If we
were to drop the assignment with the lowest score (1/5), your overall grade would be
65/115, which is approximately 56%. On the other hand, if we drop the 50/100 assignment,
your overall score is 16/20, or 80%. This class adopts the last strategy.</p>
<h4 id="is-this-class-curved">Is this class curved?</h4>
<p>The class isn't typically curved. The standard grading scale (where an A is 93+,
A- is 90+, B+ is 87+, etc.) will be used as a starting point, but once all
scores are in, we will run a clustering algorithm to automatically find the best
cutoffs for each letter grade. These cutoffs can only be lowered. For instance,
the threshold for an "A" will never be higher than 93%.</p>
