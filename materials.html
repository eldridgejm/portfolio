            In total, I have created over 6,800 slides for classes I have taught
            in the last 5 years. To make it easier to get a sense of my lecture
            style and the effort I put into the slides, I have below highlighted
            three lectures which I feel are exemplary.

            <h3>Lecture on k-d Trees, DSC 190 - Advanced Algorithms</h3>

                <p>
                  This lecture on k-d trees is written for an upper-division
                  elective on advanced algorithms and data structures for data
                  scientists. This particular lecture was delivered remotely via
                  pre-recorded YouTube videos.
                </p>

                <p>
                  These slides demonstrate a structure I commonly use in my
                  lectures:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    I start by motivating the problem of finding nearest
                    neighbors by stating its importance in a data science
                    context (e.g., the nearest neighbor classifier).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    I briefly explore the "naive" solution to the problem (brute
                    force search) and its detriments.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    I improve upon the "naive" solution with an intuitive
                    solution (build a grid) that students likely have thought
                    of. I identify what needs to be done to make it a good
                    solution.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Having identified the problems with "build a grid" idea, I
                    outline the fix (k-d trees).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Once the algorithm or data structure is introduced, I go
                    through several reinforcing examples.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    I end with a discussion of the limitations of the method we
                    just learned, often with a teaser for the next lecture's
                    topic.
                  </li>

                  This lecture on asymptotic notation and time complexity
                  analysis is written for a lower-division course on computer

                <p>
                  These slides highlight several techniques I've come to use
                  often:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <b>Outlining thought processes:</b>
                    When introducing students to a new problem-solving
                    technique, I often outline my own thought process in a
                    series of steps. In this lecture, this is demonstrated by
                    the strategy provided for working with chains of
                    inequalities, as well as the strategy for proving or
                    disproving statements about asymptotic notation.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Excercises:</b>
                    My lectures typically contain several "excercise" slides. At
                    these points in the lecture, I pause for a couple of minutes
                    to let students discuss the exercise amongst themselves.
                    Oftentimes, the exercise is directly relevant to a problem
                    that appears on an assignment, so students are
                    well-motivated to tackle them during class.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Organization:</b> definitions, main ideas, and exercises
                    are all clearly marked using different colors so that
                    students can easily come back to find them when reviewing
                    the slides. When I identify common mistakes made by
                    students, I add a big red "Warning" to the slides to allow
                    future students to learn from the mistakes of the others.
                    Lectures are broken into several small parts. In-person
                    lectures are recorded at UCSD, and I will often re-upload
                    the lecture to YouTube and link directly to each lecture
                    part on the course page, enabling students to jump right to
                    a topic that they wish to review.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                  In their end-of-quarter evaluations, students frequently
                  highlight how the design and structure of the lecture slides
                  greatly assist in their learning. For example:
                </p>

                  This lecture on the spectral theorem and eigenvectors is
                  written for an upper-division machine learning course. While
                  students have taken linear algebra and have seen the concepts
                  in this lecture before, they are usually unsure of why
                  eigenvectors are useful quantities and what they mean,
                  intuitively. This lecture comes after a series of lectures
                  which remind students that matrices are concise "encodings" of
                  linear transformations.
                </p>
                <p>
                  These slides are meant to demonstrate how I sometimes take
                  novel approaches to building intuition behind complex ideas.
                  In this lecture, I repeatedly visualize linear transformations
                  (matrices) by plotting their action on a set of unit vectors
                  (such visualizations were explained in earlier lectures). We
                  see that when the matrix is symmetric, the picture is
                  symmetric, too, and that its axes of symmetry are described by
                  the eigenvectors. This gives students a visual intuition for
                  what eigenvectors are.
                </p>

                <p>
                  We finish by realizing that the eigenvectors of the
                  transformation are maximizers/minimizers; and are therefore
                  useful in solving some of the optimization problems we often
                  encounter in data science. Later lectures on PCA and Laplacian
                  Eigenmaps reinforce this.

              A pedagogical Python package providing a sample implementation of

                A pedagogical tabular data analysis library used in DSC 10,
                <code>babypandas</code> was created by Aaron Fraenkel; I have
                contributed to it, and maintained it in the time since Aaron
                left UCSD. <code>babypandas</code> is a subset of the popular
                <code>pandas</code> Python package used throughout industry that
                is designed to be easier to learn. While there are potentially
                many ways to do the same thing in <code>pandas</code>, there is
                typically only one way to do the same thing in
                <code>babypandas</code>.

                In addition to maintaining and contributing to the codebase, I
                (along with an undergraduate student, Parker Addison) wrote the
