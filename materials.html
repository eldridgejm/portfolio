                    In total, I have created over 6,800 slides for classes I have taught in
                    the last 5 years. To make it easier to get a sense of my lecture style
                    and the effort I put into the slides, I have below highlighted three
                    lectures which I feel are exemplary.

                    <h3>Lecture on k-d Trees, DSC 190 - Advanced Algorithms</h3>
                    <p><a href="./materials/slides/highlighted/kdtrees.pdf">Slides</a></p>
                    <p>Videos:

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This lecture on k-d trees is written for an upper-division
                        elective on advanced algorithms and data structures for data
                        scientists. This particular lecture was delivered remotely via pre-recorded
                        YouTube videos.
                    </p>

                    <p>These slides demonstrate a structure I commonly
                        use in my lectures:
                    <ul>
                        <li>I start by motivating the problem of finding nearest neighbors by stating its importance in
                            a data science context (e.g., the nearest neighbor classifier).</li>
                        <li>I briefly explore the "naive" solution to the problem (brute force search) and its
                            detriments.</li>
                        <li>I improve upon the "naive" solution with an intuitive solution (build a grid) that students
                            likely have thought of. I identify what needs to be done to make it a good solution.</li>
                        <li>Having identified the problems with "build a grid" idea, I outline the fix (k-d trees).</li>
                        <li>Once the algorithm or data structure is introduced, I go through several reinforcing
                            examples.</li>
                        <li>I end with a discussion of the limitations of the method we just learned, often with a
                            teaser for the
                            next lecture's topic.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>

                    <h3>Lecture on Asymptotic Notation, DSC 40B</h3>

                    <p><a href="./materials/slides/highlighted/asymptotic.pdf">Slides</a></p>

                    <p>
                        This lecture on asymptotic notation and time complexity analysis is written
                        for a lower-division course on computer science foundations for data scientists.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        These slides highlight several techniques I've come to use often:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <b>Outlining thought processes:</b>
                            When introducing students to a new problem-solving technique,
                            I often outline my own thought process in a series of steps. In this lecture,
                            this is demonstrated by the strategy provided for working
                            with chains of inequalities, as well as the strategy for proving
                            or disproving statements about asymptotic notation.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Excercises:</b>
                            My lectures typically contain several "excercise" slides. At these points in the lecture, I
                            pause for
                            a couple of minutes
                            to let students discuss the exercise amongst themselves. Oftentimes, the exercise
                            is directly relevant to a problem that appears on an assignment, so students are
                            well-motivated to tackle them during class.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Organization:</b> definitions, main ideas, and exercises are all clearly marked
                            using different colors
                            so that students can easily come back to find them when reviewing the slides.
                            When I identify common mistakes made by students, I add a big red "Warning" to
                            the slides to allow future students to learn from the mistakes of the others.
                            Lectures are broken into several small parts. In-person lectures are recorded at
                            UCSD, and I will often re-upload the lecture to YouTube and link directly to each
                            lecture part on the course page, enabling students to jump right to a topic that
                            they wish to review.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>

                    <p>
                        In their end-of-quarter evaluations, students frequently highlight how the design and structure
                        of the lecture
                        slides greatly assist in their learning. For example:
                    </p>

                    <div class="quote">
                        Professor Eldridge is an amazing professor. He has amazing succinct presentations which are very
                        neat and orderly. He explains concepts nice and slowly, making sure you don't miss a beat. I
                        appreciate his strong design sense and color coding. He also has great handwriting. All of these
                        small things add up to form a great course, where all content is modular and easy to digest
                        [...]

                    <h3>Lecture on the Spectral Theorem, DSC 140B</h3>

                    <p><a href="./materials/slides/highlighted/eigenvectors.pdf">Slides</a></p>

                    <p>
                        This lecture on the spectral theorem and eigenvectors is written for
                        an upper-division machine learning course. While students have taken
                        linear algebra and have seen the concepts in this lecture before,
                        they are usually unsure of why eigenvectors are useful quantities
                        and what they mean, intuitively. This lecture comes after a series
                        of lectures which remind students that matrices are concise "encodings" of
                        linear transformations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These slides are meant to demonstrate how I sometimes take novel approaches
                        to building intuition behind complex ideas. In this lecture, I repeatedly
                        visualize linear transformations (matrices) by plotting their action
                        on a set of unit vectors (such visualizations were explained in earlier lectures).
                        We see that when the matrix is symmetric, the picture is symmetric, too, and that
                        its axes of symmetry are described by the eigenvectors. This gives
                        students a visual intuition for what eigenvectors are.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We finish by realizing
                        that the eigenvectors of the transformation are maximizers/minimizers; and are therefore
                        useful in solving some of the optimization problems we often encounter in data science.
                        Later lectures on PCA and Laplacian Eigenmaps reinforce this.

                            <p>
                                This homework demonstrates two techniques I often use in creating assignments.
                                The first problem demonstrates a form of <i>scaffolding</i>, where I guide students
                                through a problem-solving process. If the problem were given without breaking it into
                                parts, students might feel lost; instead, I try to make each part challenging, but
                                manageable.
                                To complete part (a), students will likely need to remember that we did a very similar
                                procedure in an earlier lecture to derive the normal equations for least squares
                                regression.
                                In part (b), they will draw upon a lecture where we derived a vector calculus identity.
                                And in part (c), they will need to recognize that optimizing the risk can be done
                                by finding the gradient, and that their answers to parts (a) and (b) are useful in that
                                regard.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The second problem demonstrates another technique I like to use, where I have students
                                "rediscover" a key idea by proving it empirically. In lecture,
                                I tried to convey the brilliance of the kernel trick by stating that kernel
                                ridge regression is equivalent to ridge regression in feature space, but
                                it can be hard to grasp what this means in the heat of lecture. So in this problem
                                I have students prove it to themselves by training both models and showing that they are
                                the same.
                                The problem is designed so as to allow students to check their own work, since
                                the predictions made by both models should agree if their work is correct. This gives
                                them instant feedback.

                            <p>This is is <i>lab</i> assignment for DSC 40B. Labs consist of a small number (usually 10)
                                questions that serve as a simple check on understanding. The labs are autograded,
                                but if a student misses a question, they can regain (most) of the lost credit by
                                talking to a teaching assistant and describing their misconception; I refer to this
                                policy as "lab redemption". This
                                mechanism
                                causes students to not only review their mistakes, but to engage with course staff.
                                Exam questions are modeled after lab questions (and lab questions are typically former
                                exam questions), and so students are highly motivated to understand the labs and know
                                what to expect on the tests.</p>

                            questions (see the example DSC 40B lab above). It also shows how I
                            create complete solutions, often with explanations, which are distributed
                            to students afterwards. I also create <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da7YLbLUiYc">recap videos</a>
                            going over the exam's solutions and my thought process for solving each
                            problem. Exams are eligible for "redemption", meaning that students can

                            content at the end of the quarter. This motivates students to learn from
